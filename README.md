This repository creates and distributes the unofficial Appimage of WPS Office built from the official .deb package using "[AppimaGen](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AppImaGen)".

It is compatible with GLIBC version from [Debian oldstable](https://packages.debian.org/source/oldstable/glibc) and above.

### NOTE: This wrapper is not verified by, affiliated with, or supported by Kingsoft Office Software.

**The base software is under a proprietary license and unofficially repackaged as an AppImage for demonstration purposes, for the original authors, to promote this packaging format to them. Consider this package as "experimental". I also invite you to request the authors to release an official AppImage, and if they agree, you can show this repository as a proof of concept.**

*"AM"/"AppMan" is a set of scripts and modules for installing, updating, and managing AppImage packages and other portable formats, in the same way that APT manages DEBs packages, DNF the RPMs, and so on... using a large database of Shell scripts inspired by the Arch User Repository, each dedicated to an app or set of applications.*

*The engine of "AM"/"AppMan" is the "APP-MANAGER" script which, depending on how you install or rename it, allows you to install apps system-wide (for a single system administrator) or locally (for each user).*

*"AM"/"AppMan" aims to be the default package manager for all AppImage packages, giving them a home to stay.*

*You can consult the entire **list of managed apps** at [**portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps**](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps).*
